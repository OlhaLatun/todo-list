# Simple TODO List app 

## Summary
TodoList app made using native JS and JSON Placeholder fake API.\
I've created this app to train separation of concerns principle in practice. 
and provide a single source of truth for the app.\
The challenge was to configure localStorage and fake API to provide SSOT.
